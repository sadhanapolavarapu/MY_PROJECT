SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS USING ML

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on textual data using machine learning techniques, specifically the Naive
Bayes classifier. Sentiment analysis aims to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, whether it is positive, negative,
or neutral.
Objective: Develop a sentiment analysis system using machine learning to classify text into positive, negative, or
neutral sentiments.
•
Methodology: Utilize the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for text classification. Preprocess textual data by
tokenizing, removing stop words, and vectorizing using CountVectorizer. Evaluate model performance with
accuracy metrics and visualize results with a confusion matrix.
•
Outcome: Successfully train and evaluate the model on a dataset (data.csv), demonstrating its ability to predict
sentiments accurately. Provide practical examples of sentiment prediction and visualize word clouds for each
sentiment category to highlight frequent words associated with positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
